Now, you can seamlessly utilize both ChatGPT from OpenAI and Gemini Pro from Google! Enjoy enhanced chat conversion and the ability to engage in multiple chat sessions with ease!

GenAI harnesses the power of advanced models like GPT-4 and Gemini Pro to serve as versatile coding and writing assistants for users in both R and, soon, Python. This toolbox empowers users with a range of capabilities, including text generation, code optimization, natural language processing, chat assistance, and image interpretation. The ultimate objective is to simplify and enhance the coding and language processing experience for users of both R and Python.

# Overview

The following image is a flowchart that describes how to use the GenAI package to generate text and chat. The flowchart starts with the user importing the GenAI package into their R or Python environment. The user is then prompted to connect to the Generative AI service providers' APIs with or without GenAI's API proxy service. If the user is successful in connecting to the API, they will be able to use the GenAI functions to generate text and chat.
