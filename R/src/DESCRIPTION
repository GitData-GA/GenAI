Description: The Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) toolbox employs models like 'GPT-4' and 'Gemini Pro' as coding and writing assistants for 'R' users. Through these models, GenAI offers a variety of functions, encompassing text generation, code optimization, natural language processing, chat, and image interpretation. The goal is to aid 'R' users in streamlining laborious coding and language processing tasks.
